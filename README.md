# 2D Platformer with PyGame
## Working on a little more python to get a hang of it.
I have always wanted to build a video game since I was a kid. Now I am going to use the knowledge given to me by <h1>4Geeks </h1>to learn more programming languages that will help me acheive that goal.
Project is still a work in progress. Might work on other projects in the meantime just to hone my skills to implement them to this project.

## To test type python3 FinalProject.py on the terminal.
